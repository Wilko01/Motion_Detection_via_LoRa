# Motion sensor communicating over LoRa
The challenge is to detect motion when someone enters the premise and send it over a longer distance to a location 50+m away where the residents are located and are triggered via a signal that someone is coming.

## Description and operation instructions
The motion sensor HC-SR501 in combination with LoRa RFM95W-868S2 transceiver is used to send a LoRa signal when motion is detected. At some distance the signal is received with a LoRa RFM95W-868S2 transceiver and LED and beeper will signal that the motion sensor was triggered. The RFM95W-868S2 are controlled via a ESP32-WROOM-32U at the sender and receiver.

 ## Technical description
The LoRa RFM95W-868S2 transceiver is connected to the ESP32-WROOM-32D

### Interface
#### Home Assistant
Home Assistant is connected via the ESPHome integration. The hazardous values for the 2.5um are different from the values of the 10.0um. Therefore two cards are made in the dashboard.

<img src="Images/Dashboard 2.5 and 10.0um.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

##### 2.5um card
Create a card in the dashboard of Home Assistant with this code for the 2.5um measurement:
```
type: entities
style:
  .: |
    ha-card {
      --ha-card-box-shadow: none;
      background-color: transparent;
      border-radius: none;

    }

  - type: custom:mini-graph-card
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.particulates_2_5um_concentration
    icon: mdi:air-filter
    height: 200
    hours_to_show: 96
    more_info: false
    hour24: true
    points_per_hour: 6
    aggregate_func: max
    color_thresholds:
      - value: 0
        color: lightgreen
      - value: 24
        color: green
      - value: 36
        color: yellow
      - value: 48
        color: orange
      - value: 54
        color: red
    line_width: 11
    font_size: 120
    show:
      graph: bar
      average: true
      extrema: true
      name: true
      icon: true
      labels: true
      labels_secondary: true
```

##### 10.0um card
Create a card in the dashboard of Home Assistant with this code for the 10.0um measurement:
```
type: entities
style:
  .: |
    ha-card {
      --ha-card-box-shadow: none;
      background-color: transparent;
      border-radius: none;

    }
entities:
  - type: custom:mini-graph-card
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.particulates_10_0um_concentration
    icon: mdi:air-filter
    height: 200
    hours_to_show: 96
    more_info: false
    hour24: true
    points_per_hour: 6
    aggregate_func: max
    color_thresholds:
      - value: 0
        color: lightgreen
      - value: 34
        color: green
      - value: 51
        color: yellow
      - value: 59
        color: orange
      - value: 76
        color: red
    line_width: 11
    font_size: 120
    show:
      graph: bar
      average: true
      extrema: true
      name: true
      icon: true
      labels: true
      labels_secondary: true

```

### NodeRed
Create a flow to alert when the quality of the air is not in the green area anymore.

```

### Testing
Create a dashboard in Home Assistant and see the measurements come in. Depending on the measurement interval this can take some time.

## 3D printer files
It all started by measuring the air quality when printing, so the 3D printer files must be included in this project:
- [3D files include the Sketchup make file as well as the 3D print files .STL](/3D_Printer_Files)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5135259)
